# UNObot
A Discord bot written in Discord.NET designed to be easy to develop upon.

UNObot uses plugins to manage all of its commands, allowing easy development and hot-patching on live servers.

## Status
UNObot is still under continuous development, though there is no roadmap.

I just do whatever I want.

## Usage
Just start UNObot. It'll generate a config file for you to use.
Plugin DLLs should be dropped into the `plugins` folder.

If you want to use the public version, it is available at https://invite-unobot.williamle.com.

## Contribution
Yes.

## License
[MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
It's the same as Discord.NET's, and I am not a lawyer.
